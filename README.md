# Type Error in TypeScript Function

This code demonstrates a type error in TypeScript. The `greet` function expects a `string` argument for the `date` parameter, but a `Date` object is passed instead. This results in a type error.

The solution shows how to fix this error by correctly passing a string representation of the date to the function.
